# echoipsum

This is a certified app experimenting with mDNS and echo servers and all that stuff in Firefox OS.

It's very simple and it's more of an exercise for me to learn than a very good example of how this should be done probably. Please excuse any weird thing here :-)

## Before running

Clone the repository
Run `npm install` on its folder (you need node.js or io.js installed).

Then you can install the app using WebIDE or install-to-adb for example. You need to run this on a phone as the simulator doesn't seem to let you do the cool stuff.
